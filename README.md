python tutorial and practice programs

### Hi, I'm Vijay !! Welcome to my python tutorial repo.

# Introduction:
Python is a general-purpose, versatile, and powerful programming language. It’s a great first language because it’s concise and easy to read. Whatever you want to do, Python can do it. From web development to machine learning to data science, Python is the language for you.

## Why to use python:
  * Great first language

  * Large programming community

  * Excellent online documentation

  * Endless libraries and packages

  *  World-wide popularity

  * Powerful and flexible

## Installation:
   The first step is to learn how to install or update Python on a local machine or computer.Visit the link https://www.python.org/downloads/ to download the latest release of Python. The particular appeal of Python is that you can write a program in any text editor, save it in .py format and then run via a Command Line. But as you learn to write more complex code or venture into data science, you might want to switch to an IDE or IDLE.(try googling the difference between IDE and IDLE as researching makes you better).After installation, try running these following commands in command prompt,
   *``` python --version ```
   * ```python```


# First Program:
  Try running this program in python IDE or your IDLE:
  ```
  print('Hello World')
  ```
